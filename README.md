# My challenges with this project:
- Insert dynamic images through Javascript;
- Learn how works Web Speech API;
- Unfortunately, the Web Speech API is not yet fully compatible with all browsers, and on Android I had to disable the voice select because I still haven't found the support to make it run perfectly. If you have already used this API, I will be glad to know your experiences to solve these problems;
